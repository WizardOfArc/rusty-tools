# How to decide what project to do?

## P.A.C.

### Pain
If there is some pain you would like to alleviate - that's good motivation.

### Annoyance
Is there a repetative/boring task that is annoying you terribly - that is a great candidate for a project.

### Curiosity
Is there something that you are curious about? Write yourself a tool to help you figure it out.
